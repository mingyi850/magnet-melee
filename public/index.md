# Rules

### Control as much space on the board as possible using your magnetic powers." 
  1. The aim of the game is to maximise the spaces controlled by your magnets' fields.
  2. Each magnet exerts a force in 8 directions - horizontally, vertically and diagonally.
  3. Control the polarity of the piece to be placed using the toggle for your player - magnets of similar polarities repel each other while magnets of opposing polarity attract each other.
  3. Each space is worth 1 point. If a space is controlled by multiple magnets, the point is split among controllers of the space.
  4. Knock opponents magnets off the edge to remove them entirely.
  5. Magnets move in a stepwise manner in the direction of the highest force (horizontally, vertically or diagonally)
  6. Magnets gain momentum! If a position is repeated during the update more than once, it will start to move with greater magnitude until the magnets settle into equilibrium.


The game ends when both players run out of moves
