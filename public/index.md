# Rules

### Control as much space on the board as possible using your magnetic powers." 
  1. The aim of the game is to maximise the spaces controlled by your magnets' fields.
  2. Each magnet exerts a radial force according to it's magnetism
    - Magnets of the same polarity repel each other while magnets of opposite polarities attract
  3. Each space is worth 1 point. If a space is controlled by multiple magnets, the point is split among controllers of the space based on the proportion of influence the magnets have on the field.
  4. Knock opponents magnets off the edge to remove them from the field.
  5. Friction on the field will decrease the magnets' speeds as they move.
  6. The game ends when both players run out of moves
  7. The winner of the game is the player with the highest influence on the board.
