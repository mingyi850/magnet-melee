# Rules

## Introduction

Control as much space on the board as possible using your magnetic powers! 
The aim of the game is to maximuse the spaces controlled by your magnets' fields. Place your pieces strategically remove other players' pieces or to reduce their powers and maximise yours. Play with up to 4 players.

## Rules
  1. Each turn, you can place a piece on the board with either positive or negative polarity.
  2. Each magnet exerts a force on it's surroundings according to it's polarity. Forces increases the velocity of a magnet.
  2. Magnets of the same polarity repel each other while magnets of opposite polarities attract
  3. Each space is worth 1 point. If a space is controlled by multiple magnets, the point is split among controllers of the space based on the proportion of influence the magnets have on the field. (The closer your magnet is to a space, the higher the influence your magnets have on the space)
  4. Move opponents magnets off the edge to remove them from the field.
  5. Friction decreases the magnets' speeds as they move. The higher the friction the slower the magnets get.
  6. The game ends when all players run out of moves.
  7. The winner of the game is the player with the highest influence on the board.
