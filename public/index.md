# Rules

## Introduction

Control as much space on the board as possible using your magnetic powers! 
The aim of the game is to maximise the spaces controlled by your magnets' fields. Place your pieces strategically remove other players' pieces or to reduce their powers and maximise yours. Play with up to 4 players.

## Rules
  1. Each turn, you can place a piece on the board with either positive or negative polarity.
  2. Each magnet exerts a force on it's surroundings according to it's polarity.
     - Magnets of the same polarity repel each other while magnets of opposite polarities attract.
     - Forces increases the velocity of a magnet.
  3. Magnets which fall off the edge of the board are removed from the field.
  4. Friction decreases the magnets' speeds as they move. The higher the friction, the slower the magnets get as they move.
  5. The game ends when all players run out of moves.
  6. Each space is worth 1 point. If a space is controlled by multiple magnets, the point is split among controllers of the space based on the proportion of        influence the magnets have on the field. (The closer your magnet is to a space, the higher the influence your magnets have on the space)
  7. The winner of the game is the player with the highest score on the board.

## Tips
  1. Try to evenly distribute your magnets on the board! Each space is only worth one point so even if you have multiple magnets near a space, it is still worth one point.
  2. Take note of the polarity of magnets on the field. You can use other magnets to reduce the speed of your magnet.
  3. Magnets which fall off the edge can no longer exert any magnetic field. Take advantage of your opponent's dangerously placed magnets and move them off the field.
